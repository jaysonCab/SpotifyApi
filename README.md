# Spotify API Project
I want to instantiate a virtual environment and download dependancies
I want to develop a function that creates an access token if it has already expired
Then I want to simply make an API call

<!--
python3 -m venv venv
source TestEnv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
